# Obtainium

Get Android App Updates Directly From the Source.

Obtainium allows you to install and update Open-Source Apps directly from their releases pages, and receive notifications when new releases are made available.

Currently supported App sources:
- GitHub
- GitLab

## Limitations
- App installs are assumed to have succeeded; failures and cancelled installs cannot be detected.
- Auto (unattended) updates are unsupported due to a lack of any capable Flutter plugin.
