**Prerequisites**
Please ensure your request is not part of an existing issue.

**Describe the feature**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

For new Sources, it's preferable (not required) if you suggest how an App ID (or any release-specific identifier), App version, and APK URL(s) could be scraped from the Source.

**Describe alternatives you've considered (if applicable)**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

Note that app-specific Sources are less likely to be added. In those cases, see if the HTML Source will work for you (if not, see if a generally-applicable enhancement to the HTML Source would work, and suggest that instead).

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
